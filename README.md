## .NET Core Roadmap
<hr>
The .NET Core roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. New product experiences and features will include changes in various layers of the product, in some combination of the runtime, framework, language compilers and tools. Each component may have its own component-level roadmap that will available in the repo for that component.

The .NET Core team is currently focused on Web, Cloud, Microservices, Containers, and Console applications. We encourage the community to work with us to improve .NET Core for these scenarios and extend it for others.
